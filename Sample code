# after instlling Selenium and a webdriver to your programming environment, you will need to specify the webdriver version depending on the browser you are operating from. make sure the browser version matches the webdriver version downloaded. for example, if you used Firefox you will want to enter firefox/Firefox into anywhere you see chrome/Chrome
